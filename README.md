# Introduction

**Analyzing the Stellar Classification Dataset from SDSS17** 

In this report, we delve into an intriguing dataset from Kaggle: the Stellar Classification Dataset - SDSS17, meticulously compiled by fedesoriano in January 2022. The dataset, accessible at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17/data), presents a rich tapestry of astronomical data pivotal for the classification of stars, galaxies, and quasars. Such classifications, rooted in spectral characteristics, form a cornerstone in the expansive field of astronomy. The historical progression from early star cataloguing to the modern distinction between various celestial bodies underscores the importance of this endeavor.

The dataset encompasses 100,000 observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), each marked by 17 feature columns and a class column. These features include crucial identifiers like object ID, right ascension, declination angles, and photometric system filters (ultraviolet, green, red, near-infrared, and infrared). Additional data points such as run ID, rerun ID, camera column, field ID, unique IDs for optical spectroscopic objects, redshift value, plate ID, Modified Julian Date, and fiber ID enhance the dataset's depth, offering a comprehensive view of each celestial object as either a star, galaxy, or quasar.

This project aims to analyze this dataset and contrast the findings with those of fellow Kaggle contributors. A key hypothesis underpinning this endeavor is the assertion that many Kaggle users may not fully leverage the necessary data processing methods before integrating the data into their models. The belief is that thorough and appropriate data processing is crucial for extracting meaningful insights. By implementing meticulous data processing techniques, it is anticipated that one can achieve greater accuracy and a higher Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the classification of these celestial entities.

Through this analytical journey, we aim to shed light on the nuances of data processing in astronomical datasets and its impact on model performance, hoping to contribute to the broader understanding of stellar classification.
